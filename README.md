Layer for making 2D games in C++.

An attempt to make a simple layer to ease 2D C++ game development. Meant to act as a "base" to abstract the tedious details. Still a WIP based on allegro; I would like to port it to SDL.

I'm using it for my own personal use, but I've licensed the code as "MIT" so feel free to use it.
